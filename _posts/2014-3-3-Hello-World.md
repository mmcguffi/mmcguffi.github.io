Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

<div class="github-card" data-github="mmcguffi/mmcguffi.github.io" data-width="400" data-height="150" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
